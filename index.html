		I was thinking about an old assignment from university, and I decided that it would be fun to remake it in JavaScript.
		<br><br>
		This is my attempt at a disease simulator - from a starting group of individuals, we model the spread of a disease through the population, and we can see how the different traits of the disease affect its spread.
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Mortality:</b> How lethal the disease is.</li>
			<li><b>Recoverability:</b> How likely you are to get over the disease.</li>
			<li><b>Infectiousness:</b> How effectively the disease passes from person to person.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div id="content">
		<div id="control-bar">
			<div class="sliderControl">
				Mortality:
				<div class="slider" id="mortalitySlider"></div>
			</div>
			<div class="sliderControl">
				Recoverability:
				<div class="slider" id="recoverySlider"></div>
			</div>
			<div class="sliderControl">
				Infectiousness:
				<div class="slider" id="infectionSlider"></div>
			</div>
			<div id="reset-button">Reset</div>
		</div>
		<canvas id="people-field" width="600" height="500"></canvas>
	</div>

	<div id="blurb2">
		Use the three sliders at the top to adjust the different disease stats, and the reset button to reset the population.
		<br><br>
		Infected individuals can only infect those close to them, and once an individual has recovered from the disease, they cannot be reinfected.
